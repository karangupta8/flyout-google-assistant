# FlyOut - Google Assistant Action

**FlyOut** is a Google Assistant skill that estimates when you should leave for the airport based on:
- Your flight number
- Your current location
- Real-time traffic data
- A configurable buffer (default: 2.5 hours before departure)

**Idea Date:** May 17, 2019

> **⚠️ Project Status: Partially Completed**  
> This project was started on June, 2019 but was only partially completed. Core functionality developed but did not deploy a fully working skill.

## ✨ Features
- Asks for your **flight number**.
- Fetches **flight departure details** using [AeroDatabox API](https://rapidapi.com/squawk7000/api/aerodatabox).
- Calculates travel time to the departure airport using **Google Distance Matrix API**.
- Adds a configurable **pre-departure buffer** (2.5 hours by default).
- Gives you a recommended **"leave by" time**.
- Handles **Google Assistant permissions** for location access.
- Includes regex-based validation for flight numbers.

## 💬 Usage Examples


### Sample Conversations

Say to your Google Assistant: *"Hey Google, talk to FlyOut"*

**Scenario 1: Direct Flight Number**
- User: "My flight is AI946"
- Assistant: "I found your flight AI946 departing at 2:30 PM. Based on current traffic, you should leave by 11:45 AM to arrive 2.5 hours before departure."


**Scenario 2: No Flight Number**
- User: "I don't have a flight number"
- Assistant: "No problem! What time is your flight departing?"

## 📌 API Flow

### MainProcessor{}

```
FlightDetails(in_FlightNum) {
    // Returns: Out_DepartTime[utc], out_AirportLoc[lat&long]
}

GetTime(in_AirportLoc, in_userLoc) {
    // Returns: out_eta
}

calculateTime(in_departTime) {
    totalTime = outEta + 2.5
    Leave_time[utc] = deparTtime - totalTime
}
```

### Conversation Flow
1. **Ask Flight number** - "Do you have a flight number?"
2. **User Response** - Yes/No
3. **If Yes** - Process flight number and calculate departure time
4. **If No** - Ask for departure time or flight number
